Hex-/Dec-/Oct-/Bin-dumper

A basic hex/oct/dec/bin-dumper wherein each byte of input is printed in
* binary (bbbbbbbb),
* decimal (??n),
* octal(ooo), or
* hexadecimal (xx)
form.

All the other hexdumpers were too fancy for my purposes so I hacked together the hexdump
then wrote the rest.

This code is released in the public domain, but donations are encouraged.
